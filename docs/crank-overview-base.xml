    <title>Fundamental Support</title>
    <para>
      Crank System is fairly a large library which provides complex features,
      from basic vector computations, to scene rendering, and other tasks.
      
      Fundamental part of Crank System provides versioning and general purpose
      macros, typedefs.

    <title>Basic Data Structures</title>
    <para>
      Although Crank System is a game support library, it contains some
      mathematical structures like Permutation, complex types. This would be 
      useful modeling or simulating parts of world.

    <title>Vectors and Matrices</title>
    <para>
      Vectors and Matrix types are frequently used in 3D applications, and also
      in games, as they can represent arbitarly position in 2D/3D space.
      
      Might not useful in most of games, but Crank System also provides complex
      vector and matrix for modeling, and simulating.
    </para>

  <refsect1 id="graph">
    <title>Graphs</title>
    <para>
      Crank System also provides graphs which are used through out games.
      Currently, Crank System only provides digraph implementation.
